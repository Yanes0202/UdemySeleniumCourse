Step-by-step guide how to set up GitHub hooks with Jenkins:

1. To use Jenkins locally you need to download jenkins.war file, after that you can run this by using "java -jar [fileName].war" command.
2. You can also add "java -jar [fileName].war --httpPort=9090" to change port of the jenkins
3. For the first login you will get credentials in console.
4. Access jenkins by typing http://localhost:9090/ in the browser.
5. Let jenkins download required plugins and additionally add Maven Integration.
6. Download maven bin file and paste it somewhere in your computer.
7. Go to system environment variables and add MAVEN_HOME variable with the path to maven file.
8. Edit system environment variable "Path" and add %MAVEN_HOME%\bin to it.
9. In jenkins manage/configureTools/ find Maven tab and type a maven name and paste MAVEN_HOME from your computer.
10. You can also mark install automatically, install from apache and chose version of the maven (had some difficulties without this one)
11. Add new jenkins project, set code repository to git and paste a path from your gitHub.
12. Now, in gitHub go to settings/developer settings/personal access tokens.
13. Generate new personal access token (classic) write a note, give all scopes and save.
14. Copy this token, go back to jenkins and under gitHub url link, below Credentials Click add and Jenkins.
15. In Kind select "secret text", paste text to secret and press "add" button.
16. !IMPORTANT! Remember to mark as set "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" option in Build trigger tab
17. In Build tab you can set up maven command in "Goals and options" for example: "test -PRegression"
18. !IMPORTANT! In Build tab in advanced settings set "Settings file" to "Use default maven settings"
19. Save project.
20. Try to run it.
21. To be able to make this work you need to redirect from your local to the public web, you can do it using ngrok.
22. Create account there and go with their instructions: download ngrok and add auth token using their command and deploy app online "ngrok http http://localhost:[YOUR PORTS]".
23. Console should give you this information "Forwarding                    https://4fad-31-182-252-52.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:9090 ".
24. This left url is where your app is forwarded to, copy it.
25. Now in jenkins go to manage/system GitHub tab, advanced and click "Specify another hook URL for GitHub configuration" you should be able to see the link to webhook.
26. It should look like this "http://localhost:8080/github-webhook/" now take forwarded url and add /github-webhook/ to it.
27. Unmark "Specify another hook URL for GitHub configuration".
28. In gitHub repository settings/webhooks click add webhook, paste combined url and save.
29. Try to make some changes in the code and see if it works.
