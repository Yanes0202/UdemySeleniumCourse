Selenium Grid is used to run test in parallel in different machines.

We have a few grid roles:
Standalone, Hub Node, Distributed

1. Go to Selenium official download page and download Selenium Server.
2. Create a folder and paste downloaded jar to it.
3. Open terminal in the folder and then execute "java -jar [jarName] hub".
4. To check if Grid works type "http://localhost:4444/".
5. Add to Selenium Grid folder all drivers that you want to use (ChromeDriver, EdgeDriver etc.).
6. Do not close previous terminal open new tab and execute "java -jar [jarName] node --detect-drivers true".
